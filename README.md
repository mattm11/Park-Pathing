# Park-Pathing

A program that emulates and predicts ride times at Disney World's Magic Kingdom theme park. Unzip the file and run the 'main' application.
- The program grabs the last three years worth of ride times for 24 of Magic Kingdom's popular attractions and averages all the wait times over each day of the month and year.
- We ask the user what day of the year they are visiting, how many rides they'd like to go on, and which rides they choose.
- We show the user a greedy path for choosing the shortest wait times for the rides they selected, and advance the world clock based on the current ride wait, the ride duration, and about 10-20 minutes for time in between walking to the next ride.

This was a short group project for DS&A where we were comparing how quickly our data was stored and used with C++ STL's unordered maps versus ordered maps
